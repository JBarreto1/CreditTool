Creating a tool for calculating optimal credit card point accumulation

This tool is a fully front-end (for now) React app. It's main feature is that it takes monthly categorized spending data and returns a list of the top ten credit cards sorted by points.
The tool is being developed in connection with JustStartInvesting.com, a personal finance blog, based on the current excel-based tool.
